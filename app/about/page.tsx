              I am a dedicated front-end engineer with a deep passion for

              I began my professional journey by earning a cum laude degree in
              Hospitality Management in Serbia, which laid a strong foundation
              for my former career. For over a decade, I thrived in the
              restaurant industry, particularly in the realm of bar programs and
              mixology. My passion for crafting unique cocktails even earned me
              several awards.

              However, when I became a mother, I yearned for a career that would
              provide more time for my family while allowing me to harness my
              creativity and continue learning. It was during this
              transformative period that I discovered software engineering and
              decided to embark on a new path. With my son just two months old,
              I enrolled in a software engineering bootcamp, dedicating myself
              to mastering this new skill. Remarkably, I completed the bootcamp
              in just 10 months and swiftly secured a position as a junior
              software engineer.

              Over the past two years in this field, I take immense pride in my
              perseverance through the challenges and in the vast knowledge
              I&apos;ve gained since May 2020. My career transition has been a
              testament to my determination and commitment to personal growth.

              I was born in Bosnia and Herzegovina and raised in Serbia. At the
              age of 26, I embarked on a life-changing journey to the United

              Leaving behind my family, friends, and the comfort of my familiar
              surroundings, I ventured into the unknown in search of a place to
              call home. Adapting to a new culture while holding onto cherished
              memories of my homeland proved to be a formidable challenge, but
              it was on this path that I encountered incredible individuals who
              helped me discover my inner strength.

            music. Together, we enjoy in the simple pleasures of dance, play,
